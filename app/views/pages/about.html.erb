      <h1>About</h1>
      <p class="lead">The goal of the <i>Woke Windows Project</i> is to bring transparency to the activites of law enforcement in our community.</p>
      <p>We wish to be a resource for journalists and policy makers, but also for all the residents, workers, and students of the <a href="https://www.boston.gov/">City of Boston</a> and the <a href="https://www.mass.gov/">Commonwealth of Massachusetts</a> more generally.</p>
      <p> We collect data from public sources. We combine these data to form inter-linked reports and tables that give every individual the ability to understand policing in their community.</p>
      <p>Our focus at this time is on <a href="https://bpdnews.com/">The Boston Police Department</a>, because the activites of our local police have the greatest immediate impact on our lives.</p>
      <p>We do our work in the open, collaborating using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">Open-source software</a> methods and tools.</p>
