Senator Graham insisted that we meet with him again in the near
future on bills that are important to us. WE CERTAINLY WILL!

In the City Council:

O

n a very sad note, Councilor Tim McCarthy has announced
that he will not be seeking re-election when his term expires
this year. This is a huge loss for the BPPA; he has been a stalwart
supporter. Thank you for always being in support of, or against,
issues that mattered most to our members and families. We wish him
well in his next endeavor (whatever it might be) and know he will
remain a friend of the BPPA.
