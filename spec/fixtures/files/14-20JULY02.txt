LE,

UI respectfully submit the following report regarding my actions taken during the SWAT CD99 event at 33 Wellington
Street, #402 on 02 July 2014 involving an EDP armed with a knife.

   
  

South End to assist EMS with an

At ab a4 units were dispatched to
EDP armed with a knife. Upon arrival these officers met with the subject's father, Bruce Angus, who
informed the officers that his son isi off his medications & has been consuming alcohol and was now armed

with a butcher knife in his apartment. Officers ascended to the apartment and observed this person in the front living
room area seated on a couch olding a large butcher knife. The subject was also observed stabbing
the sofa. These officers asked the subject numerous times to drop the knife and he would not. At about 1545 Hrs the
D-4 Patrol Supervisor, Sgt Mike O'Hara (K909) declared a CD99 event triggering a SWAT & CNT cail-out.

| was in the base preparing for my regularly scheduled first half tour of duty when | became aware of the CD99, |
immediately assembled what SWAT operators | had available & prepared them to respond along with me to the
scene. | also sent out a page alerting the Team of the CD99 & assigned Officer MacNeil to man the phones to create

a list of Operators responding.

| responded to the scene with Officers Harewood, Manning & Ashman arriving at about 1615 hrs. | assigned Officer
Harewood the Less Lethal bean bag 12 gauge shotgun and instructed Ashman & Manning to form a shield team & |
would provide lethal coverage for Officer Harewood.

We entered and ascended to the fourth floor. Upon entering apartment{iive relieved the D-4
Officers tha med an immediate action team in the event that the subject became combative,
began self inflicting or advanced upon the negotiators.

Sgt Det Matthews (CNT Commander) was already engaging the subject in conversation. The subject was in the front
living room area sitting on a sofa, with his feet up. He was positioned in a way that he was looking straight down the
hall way where we were positioned. This living room area had a table in it along with another sofa and the subject had
a box fan turned on pointed at him providing some cooling in the hot apartment. The weather was very hot (90's) and
humid and there was no air cooling systems in the apartment save the box fan.

The subject was holding a large butcher type knife in his right hand in a manner that if he raised his hand the knife
would be in a stabbing position.

Sgt Det Matthews continued with his dialogue while other SWAT team members arrived and were positioned. The
YCO3 (Supt O'Rourke) was now the OIC for the event with Lt McGoldrick and Captain Crossen commanding SWAT /
CNT & K9. Supt Merner (YCO04) & Dept Sup Colm Lyden were present as well.

At about 1725 Hrs Sgt Det Matthews ceased negotiations with the subject as he felt he was at an impasse and could
not broker a surrender due to the subject's mental state. ,

The OIC was briefed prior and a tactical plan was devised to implement if the situation was turned over to SWAT for
resolution.

The agreed upon plan formulated by myself & Lt McGoldrick was as follows:

Two shield teams were assembled in a bedroom (Francis-MacNeil + Wright & Pietroski) and these teams would be
used to take the subject into custody following the deployment of an NFDD (Ashman) — chemical munitions (Mk 9 OC-
Vapor — Meade) and if needed, engagement with the bean bag less lethal system (Harewood).

lWhen the plan was set to be executed, the officers involved would don their protective masks so as not to be seen or
detected by the subject — once all protective masks were in place & the shield teams were set, while the negotiator
was still talking with the subject the NFDD would be deployed (Ashman), Officers Ashman & Manning would then grab
the negotiator and move into the bedroom on the right clearing the hallway for the advancing shield teams. If the
subject had not released the knife chemical munitions would be deployed (Meade), and subsequent deployment of the
super sock drag stabilized bean bag rounds (Harewood) if needed, prior to inserting the shield teams.

ithe shield team’s insertion would be the last portion — using the ballistic shield’s protection to pin the subject's body
while the light & cuff officers attempted to secure the subject's arms to prevent a stabbing. Other SWAT Team
members would be brought to bear only if needed.

Once Sgt Det Matthews concluded negotiations & informed me that he was at an impasse and would be advising the
OIC to turn the situation over to SWAT, | gave the team the order to don protective masks and assemble. A few
seconds tater Lt McGoldrick informed us to stand down as the OIC wanted more negotiations to take place.

At about 1815 Hrs Sgt Det Lembo (CNT Negotiator) engaged the subject in negotiation. At about 1850 Hrs Sgt Det
Lembo concluded, also reaching an impasse.

At about 1905 hrs Supt. Merner (Commander — BIS) began to engage the subject in negotiating a surrender. At about
2035 hrs Supt Memer concludes dialogue with the subject, also reaching an impasse.

| was present at the living room doorway during all the attempted negotiations. | did hear the subject say numerous
times that he was not leaving this couch — that he felt safe there. He also said several times that he would not release
the knife and that "He was in charge — not us”. He said these same things to each negotiator.

At about 2039 hrs the OIC authorized SWAT to implement a tactical resolution plan and the team is readied. There
were no active negotiations taking place at this time as was previously planned.

At about 2042 hrs the plan was initiated upon my command with Officer Ashman (Officer Manning is now his shield
Iman) deploying his NFDD (CTS Model 7290M NFDD — serial # £502662 - Officer Ashman is trained and certified to
deploy these devices) just inside the doorway where it deflagrated successfully. | looked into the room and observed
the subject still holding the knife in his right hand. [ then deployed a Mk-9 canister of OC-Vapor chemical munitions
into the room. | then heard the subject say “what the fuck is that’. [looked in and the subject had moved from his
seated position on the couch & was now kneeling on the floor with his right side exposed to me — he still had the knife
clenched in his right hand.

| then ordered Officer Harewood to deploy the less lethal bean bag gun by yelling “Bean bag!" Officer Harewood
stepped near the doors threshold and deployed the less lethal bean bag gun system (Remington 870 pump action 12
gauge shotgun Serial # 422M — using CTS Super Sock # 2581 drag stabilized bean bag rounds — Officer Harewood is
fa less lethal instructor and a firearms instructor and he is trained & certified to use this system).

He deployed the system five times on my order — each time he deployed a round | observed that the subject still had
the knife in his hand and each subsequent deployment was based on this — the subject did not release the knife.

Officer Harewood then moved from the door as | yelled out for the shield teams to advance. | then stepped into the
room to the right. The subject was still on his knees and | saw that the chemical munitions had taken some effect on
him as he was having difficulty breathing. | then utilized my department issued collapsible baton and struck the
subject on his right wrist which caused the subject to release the knife.

The shield teams then attempted to place the subject in flex-cuffs to which the subject resisted greatly. The subject
thwarted officer's attempts to cuff him by lying facedown with his hands held tight into his chest. The subject was
yelling incoherently and thrashing about. Additional OC Vapor was introduced by Officer Pietroski which also had little

leffect. Eventually the officers used my baton to pry the subject’s arms from his chest (as trained by the BPD Academy
Staff) and he was finally taken into custody and flex-cuffed at about 2045 hrs.

 

The subject was immediately taken from the apartment to EMS who were waiting to offer aid in decontamination and to
check for any injuries sustained. The subject was transported to BMC for evaluation & treatment & the subject's father
was at the scene throughout the event. The subject did receive injuries from the bean bag rounds (contusions —
lscrapes) as he was struck on the torso, right thigh and right forearm.

(Officer Harewood was transported to BMC after the event having sustained an injury to his ears & for stress testing.

Officer O'Connor was transported to the Brigham & Women’s hospital for a shoulder injury sustained during the
struggle to contro! the subject.

Both officers were treated and released that same night and returned to full duty with no interruption in work status.

The scene was turned over to Lt Det Conley and his D-4 Detective staff to process and photograph the apartment.
We did recover the NFDD body per our protocol (ATF Log completed).

[Supt Merner declared that there would be no FDIT response to the bean bag gun deployment as he was present for
the event, to which the OIC concurred.

 

All SWAT personnel (except the officers at the hospitals) returned to SOD Base to debrief the incident - CD99
resolved.
